A python-based script to manage bookstore inventory, using sqlite3

--- Installation ---
The script can be run directly from an IDE that supports Python (VS Code).
The database file must be in the same folder as the script, otherwise a new database will be created.

-- Features -- 
Extensible code. All database queries are procedurally generated, so the addition of new values to the book class does
not require writing or rewriting of existing code base. 

-- Main Menu --

Access options for adding, searching, editing and displaying the contents of the database.

The database is searchable and will return partial matches, based on selected table columns.
